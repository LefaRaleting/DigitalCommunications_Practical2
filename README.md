# DigitalCommunications_Practical2
Develop a simulation platform1 for a communication system transmitting information over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) multipath channel. Use the simulation platform developed in Practical 1 to develop a simulation platform that includes the effect of multipath in the received signal, where the channel impulse response (CIR) length is L = 3.

# See Practical Guide for a more detailed description.
